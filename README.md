# Energy Calibration & Resolution for Scintillation and Semiconductor Detectors

This repository contains the analysis, Python code, and data associated with my MSc dissertation project at the University of Glasgow. The project focused on comparing the **energy calibration** and **resolution performance** of various radiation detectors for **quantitative measurement of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORMs)**.

## Project Overview

Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORMs) contribute significantly to environmental background radiation and must be monitored to ensure public and occupational safety.  

This project aimed to evaluate several gamma-ray detector systems under controlled laboratory conditions, using multi-channel analyser (MCA) data, Gaussian peak fitting, and calibration techniques. By establishing resolution–energy relations for different detectors, their suitability for laboratory and field-based monitoring was assessed.

## Detectors Studied

The following detectors were investigated:

- NaI (Sodium Iodide) – good low-energy resolution, widely used in field detection  
- LYSO (Lutetium-Yttrium Oxyorthosilicate) – fast decay time, good for higher energies  
- BGO (Bismuth Germanate) – excellent stopping power at very high energies  
- CsI (Cesium Iodide) – intermediate performance, limited at high energies  
- Plastic Scintillator – low resolution, useful mainly for timing applications  
- HPGe (High-Purity Germanium) – benchmark detector with unmatched resolution, but requires cryogenic cooling

## Methods

1. Data Acquisition  
   - Radiation sources were measured using scintillator and semiconductor detectors.  
   - MCA spectra were recorded and calibrated against known gamma-ray lines.  

2. Python Analysis  
   - Gaussian fitting applied to photopeaks to extract centroids and FWHM values.  
   - Calibration curves generated by mapping channel numbers to known energies.  
   - Detector resolution calculated using:  
     ```
     Resolution (%) = (FWHM / E_peak) × 100
     ```
   - Resolution–energy relations established for each detector.  

3. Comparative Analysis  
   - Experimental results compared against theoretical expectations (∝ 1/√E).  
   - Real-world NORM samples (e.g., pitchblende, gummite, Hunterston beach sand) analysed.

## Results

- NaI – best overall for low-energy gamma spectroscopy and field monitoring  
- LYSO – competitive with NaI at higher energies due to density and fast decay  
- BGO – strong at very high energies but poor resolution at low energies  
- CsI – intermediate performer, limited by long decay times  
- Plastic scintillator – poor resolution (>20%), unsuitable for spectroscopy  
- HPGe – gold standard for resolution (~0.2% at 662 keV), ideal for lab use but impractical in field  

**Key finding:**  
NaI is the most practical detector for routine NORM surveys, while HPGe remains the reference standard for high-resolution laboratory spectroscopy.
